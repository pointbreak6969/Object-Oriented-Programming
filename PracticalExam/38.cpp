// Design a SoccerPlayer class that includes three integer fields: a playerâ€™s jersey number, number
// of goals, number of assists and necessary constructors to initialize the data members. Overload the

// assists is greater than that of the others. Create and array of 11 soccer players, then use the overload
// > operator to find the player who has the greatest total of goals plus assists.
